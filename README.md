### Step 1

- [First resource](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11011876/)
- [Second resource](https://newsroom.spectrumhealth.org/corewell-health-study-determines-keys-to-reducing-hospital-readmissions/)
- [Third resource](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8101040/)

### Step 3

- Facility Name (string): the name of the facility/clinic where data was collected.
- Facility ID (int): the unique id number associated with the facility/clinic where data was collected.
- State (string): the US state abbreviation in which the facility resides.
- Measure Name (string): the measure that the facility is reporting data on.
- Number of Discharges (int): The total number of patients that have been discharged from the facility between the Start Date and End Date and for the given measure. 
- Footnote (int): I cannot find an exact definition on their site, but footnote is generally some kind of additional notes or clarifications made by the facility. The majority of footnotes are blank anyway.
- Excess Readmission Ratio (float): The ratio of a facility's actual readmissions to an expected number of readmissions. A number >1 means there are more readmissions than expected. 
- Predicted Readmission Rate (float): The derived rate (as a percentage) at which readmissions are expected to occur within the reporting period. 
- Expected Readmission Rate (float): The target readmission rate (as a percentage) that the facility's stats are compared against. 
- Number of Readmissions (string): The total number of patient readmissions in the reporting period. This column has to be a string because in some cases, the value is "Too Few to Report" for privacy reasons. 
- Start Date (date): The beginning date of the reporting period in which the data were collected.
- End Date (date): The final date of the reporting period in which the data were collected.
